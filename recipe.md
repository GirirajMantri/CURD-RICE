1- Rinse 1 cup of rice and place it in a pressure cooker with 3 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Pressure cook the rice until very soft- 2 to 3 whistles on high heat then lower the heat and cook for additional 2 to 3 minutes. Let the pressure release on its own.

2- Once the rice is cooked, mash it a little using a masher or back of a spoon or using your hands. You may also leave it as is if you donâ€™t like mashed rice. Transfer rice to a large bowl and let it cool completely.

3- Once the rice has cooled completely, add in the whisked yogurt and milk and mix to combine. I add around 2 cups of whisked yogurt because I like a lot of it, you can adjust to taste and reduce the quantity.

4- Then add in the grated carrot, chopped cilantro and green chili and mix to combine.
5- Now for the tempering/tadka, heat oil in a small pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop.

6- Then add the urad dal and cook until it starts changing color. (Tip: if you want dal to be soft and not super crunchy in the tadka, just soak it in water for 10 minutes before using in the recipe).

7- Add the ginger, curry leaves and dried red chilies. Cook until the curry leaves turn crisp.

8- Transfer the tadka to the bowl of curd rice and mix.
